This file is dedicated to the development of a website that will show our answer to the question: "how scientific collaboration has been impacted by the covid 19 pandemic".

in an effort to best expose relevant analyses, we have come up with this version of the site which seems to us to have the most optimal layout to easily understand the strategy we deploy and the analyses that we made for the project.
Indeed, it seemed relevant to us to use angular to obtain efficient code as well as clear and advanced graphic representations provided by the D3 library.

the data used by the site are stored on an external server, which returns them to us via an API managed in the 'back' folder.
